# Projects

Here are some projects Iâ€™m working on:

## Data Science Project Ideas
- **Math SBAC Score Analysis in Stanislaus County, California**: Math SBAC Score Analysis in Stanislaus County, California.
This project aims to explore and quantify how socioeconomic factors influence students' math scores in Stanislaus County, California, as measured by the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC) exams. By understanding the correlation between math performance and factors such as family income, parental education level, access to resources, and neighborhood characteristics, this project seeks to identify patterns and potential inequities that may contribute to performance disparities across different student populations.
